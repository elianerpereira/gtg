[GTG Plugin]
Module=rtm_sync
Name=Remember the milk
Description="Plugin for synchronising Getting Things Gnome! with the web\nservice Remember the milk  (http://www.rememberthemilk.com)\nPlease note that:\n - RTM does not support fuzzy dates (Soon, Now ..). The \n   plugin tries to maintain your fuzzy dates in GTG, but keep\n   in mind that your fuzzy dates will be erased if the task\n   is updated in RTM (as the plugin cannot decide if you \n   wanted to clear the date or not)\n - RTM uses tags in lowercase. Because of this, after a couple\n   of synchronizations your GTG tags will be converted\n   to lowercase.\n\nThis plugin is in its early stage so your mileage may vary.\nTask descriptions and tags are not synchronized in this version.\n\nLegal note: This product uses the Remember The Milk API but\nis not endorsed or certified by Remember, The Milk."
