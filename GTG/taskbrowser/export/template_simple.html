So you want to write your own template for Getting things GNOME?
Cool. Now, these templates are interpreted with a python library 
called Cheetah. If you know a little about python or some other
scripting languare, just dive in, it's really straightforward.
Otherwise, a nice and easy tutorial about it can be found 
here:
http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/Templating-with-Cheetah/

The last thing you may want to know are the variables you can use.
Here's the list (remember to add $ before the variable name):
tasks          -> The list of all exported tasks
task.title     -> The task title
task.has_title -> True/False, wheter the task has a title (it should)
task.text      -> The task description
task.has_text
task.status    -> The task status (Active,..)
task.has_status
task.subtasks  -> List of subtasks
task.has_subtasks

If you write down a nice template, please send it back to the GTG project:
go to https://edge.launchpad.net/gtg, and open a bug requesting to include your
template (remember to attach the file). It's good karma!
