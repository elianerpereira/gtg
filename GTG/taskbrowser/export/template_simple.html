So you want to write your own template for Getting things GNOME?
Cool. Now, these templates are interpreted with a python library 
called Cheetah. If you know a little about python or some other
scripting languare, just dive in, it's really straightforward.
Otherwise, a nice and easy tutorial about it can be found 
here:
http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/Templating-with-Cheetah/

The last thing you may want to know are the variables you can use.
Here's the list:
tasks                -> The list of all exported tasks
task.title           -> The task title
task.has_title       -> True/False, wheter the task has a title (it should)
task.text            -> The task description
task.has_text
task.status          -> The task status (Active,..)
task.has_status
task.subtasks        -> List of subtasks
task.has_subtasks
task.tags            -> List of tags
task.has_tags
task.modified
task.has_modified
task.due_date
task.has_due_date
task.closed_date
task.has_closed_date
task.start_date
task.has_start_date
task.days_left
task.has_days_left

## Remember to put a $ before any varible (e.g.: $tasks), I won't do
## it here so that it shows up in the source of the generated html
## (the ## are the comment escaping in Cheetah, so these line won't 
## show up)

If you write down a nice template, please send it back to the GTG project:
go to https://edge.launchpad.net/gtg, and open a bug requesting to include your
template (remember to attach the file). It's good karma!
