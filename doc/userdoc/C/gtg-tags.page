  <title>Tag your Tasks</title>

  <p>Tag is a simple word that begins with the sign &quot;@&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>When you type a word beginning with @, it will appear higlighted yellow which is the indicator that <app>GTG</app> considers the word to be a tag.</p>

  <p>Tags are useful to sort your tasks. In the <gui>View</gui> menu, you can enable the <gui>Tags Sidebar</gui> which displays all the tags you have used, in a way that you can easily see and select only the tasks with a given tag by clicking on it. There's no limit to the number of tags a task can have.</p>

  <p>You can drag-n-drop a tag onto another to create "subtags". As an example, if you drag the tag @to_pay onto the tag @money, every task tagged with @to_pay will also appear in the view of @money (but the @money tag is not added to the task).</p>

  <p>New tag is only added to the current task - there's no recursion and the tag is not applied to subtasks. However, when you create a new subtask, it will inherit the tags of its parents, but you can modify at any time the tags of a subtask to make it different from its parents if required.</p>
