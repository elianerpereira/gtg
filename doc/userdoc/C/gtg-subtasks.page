  <title>Insert Subtasks</title>
  
<p>Even the biggest project is only a simple list of tasks. Often, in order to accomplish a certain task, you first need to accomplish another, separate task. GTG calls this <em>prerequisite</em> task a <em style="strong">Subtask</em>. You can insert as many subtasks as you need for each task.</p>

 <section id="gtg-create-new-subtask">
 <title>Create a New Subtask</title>

  <p>To create a subtask for the task that is currently opened, you can:</p>

 <list>
      <item><p>Start a new line with "-" and write the subtask title.</p></item>
      <item><p>Click the <gui>Insert the subtask in this task</gui> button in the task editor toolbar.</p></item>
      <item><p>Use the <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>Shift</key><key>N</key></keyseq> keyboard shortcut.</p></item>  
</list>

<p>Subtask title will appear with an arrow bullet and underlined as a link: if you click the link it will open the subtask in a separate task editor window.</p>

<p>You can reorganize tasks and subtasks by drag-n-drop in the tasks browser to achieve the hierarchy and order that you require. However, keep in mind that subtasks obey to certain rules. For example, a subtask's due date can never be after its parent's due date, and when you mark a parent task as done, its subtasks will also be marked as done.</p>
