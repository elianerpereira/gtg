====== Getting Things Gnome! ======

Getting Things Gnome! (gtg) is a personnal organizer for the gnome desktop who was inspired by the Getting Things Done methodology (GTD). It is not a GTD only software as it aims for flexibility, adaptability and ease of use.

GTG wants to help you to track everything you need to do and need to know, from very small tasks to big projects.

===== Dependencies =====

GTG depends on Python (>= 2.5), PyGTK, python ConfigObj, python gobject, python XDG. Please refer to your system documentation for information on how to install these modules if they're not currently available.

For debian based distributions, you need to install the following packages :
python-gtk2, python-glade2, python-xdg, python-gobject, python-configobj

===== Installing and Running =====

GTG is available as a seutptools enabled package. Installation procedures for those are easy:

Either unpack the tarball 
    
    $ tar xvfz gtg.tar.gz

or check out our bazaar branch for a development version (we try to keep those 
unbroken and ready for production use)
    
    $ bzr branch lp:gtg

From there, you can either run pyroom from commandline

    $ cd gtg/
    $ ./gtg

Or install it system wide

    $ cd gtg
    $ python setup.py install # as root
    $ gtg

==== Usage ====

When editing a task, keep in mind that :
1) A line beginning with "-" will automatically create a subtask on this line
2) A word beginning with "@" is a tag
