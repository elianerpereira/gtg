"Tags are useful to sort your tasks. In the view menu, you can enable a "

"tasks assigned to a given tag. There's no limit to the number of tags a task "

"\n"
"You can drag-n-drop a tag onto another to create \"subtags\". As an example, "
"if you drag the tag @to_pay onto the tag @money, every task tagged with "
"@to_pay will also appear in the view of @money (but the @money tag is not "
"added to the task).\n"

"way.\n"
"\n"
"A new tag is only added to the current task. There's no recursion and the "
"tag is not applied to subtasks. But when you create a new subtask, this "
"subtask will inherit the tags of its parent as a good primary default (it "
"will also be the case if you add a tag to a parent just after creating a "
"subtask). Of course, you can modify at any time the tags of this particular "
"subtask. It will never be changed by the parent."
